# CIFS_Crawl
CIFS Storage Crawl
In summary, this script automates the process of traversing a specified directory (and its subdirectories) on a Windows CIFS share, collecting information about files larger than 1 GB, and storing this information in a CSV file for further analysis or reporting. The tqdm library is used to provide visual progress feedback during the crawling process.
